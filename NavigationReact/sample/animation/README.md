# Navigation Animation
Navigation doesn't own your components so it integrates well with other libraries, like React Motion.  

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the animation example:

    npm install
    npm run build
	
Then open app.html to see animated Navigation in action. Click a link to slide the new view in from the left or right.
