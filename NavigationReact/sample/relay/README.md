# Navigation Relay
Navigation doesn't own your components so it integrates well with other libraries, like Relay.  

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Relay example:

    npm install
    npm run start
	
Then visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to see Navigation Relay in action.
