# React Native Navigation
The Navigation router's crumb trail combined with React Motion's animation makes for great React Native navigation. It's built in ReactDOM because React Native development is prohibitively slow on Windows. If you'd like to help make it work on React Native, let me know.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the animation example:

    npm install
    npm run build
	
Then open app.html to see native Navigation in action. Click a tweet to scale the current view back and slide the new view in from the right. Then click the back button to slide the current view out to the right and grow the old view back in.
