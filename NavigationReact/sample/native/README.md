# Native Navigation
Navigation's data-first approach and crumb trail tracking means the router works just as well on Native as it does on the Web. 

## Run
Follow React Native's Getting Started guide to set up your development environment.
### Android 
I assume you're using Android sdk version 24. If you're using the older version then open the the build.gradle in the app folder and change the 24 to 23.
### iOS
I don't have access to iOS. If you'd like to implement the iOS version please get in touch or send me a PR.
