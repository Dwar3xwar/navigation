            <h1>Tutorial</h1>
            <p>
                The Navigation library is a new kind of router for building Single Page Applications (SPAs). It works
                in all browsers and with all web libraries, from Angular to React. What follows is an interactive tutorial
                to get you familiar with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a series of coding Exercises, each one introducing a different Navigation topic. Edit the code and press
                the 'Run' button once you're happy. If you're correct, a button will appear to take you to the next Exercise.
                Don't worry if you get stuck. Pressing the 'Cheat' button reveals the answer and allows you to progress.
            </p>
            <h2>The Scenario</h2>
            <p>
                You've been tasked with building an application that allows users to edit a list of people. You're going to
                build it as a master details SPA, consisting of two views. The first will display a paged list of people.
                Clicking on a person in the list will take the user to the second, an editable view of that person's details.
            </p>
            <h2>Exercise 1: Configuring States</h2>
            <p>
                Your SPA has two routes: a 'people' route for the listing view and a 'person' route for the details view.
                The Navigation library thinks in in terms of States rather than routes. There's a 1 to 1 relationship
                between a State and a route. In this first exercise you'll create a listing State and a details State
                mapped to these two routes. You'll also wrap these States inside a Dialog. A Dialog groups related States
                togther, indicating which of them is the first to display.
            </p>
