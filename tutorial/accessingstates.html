    <h1>Exercise 2: Accessing States</h1>
    <p>
        If you've used a router before you've probably encountered a route handler. It's a function that's associated 
        with a route and runs when that route is activated. Navigation has State controllers in place of route handlers. 
        They serve the same purpose, except they're attached to States instead of routes.
    </p>
    <p>
        It would be too limiting to have to define the listing controller at the same time as you created the listing 
        State. Navigation provides access to the States after they've been configured and built so you can create the 
        controller at the same time as you create your listing view model. You access the States through their parent 
        Dialog. In this Exercise, you'll familiarise yourself with this access code. This will pave the way for creating 
        State controllers in later Exercises.
