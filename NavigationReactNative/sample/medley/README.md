# Native Medley Navigation
Navigation gives you complete control over your animation. Use the State information to decide how each scene mounts and unmounts.

## Run
Follow React Native's Getting Started guide to set up your development environment. Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies:

    npm install

Then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the example on your chosen device. Almost all the code is shared between iOS and Android. The four States mount and unmount from different directions.
