# Native Medley Web Navigation
Navigation React Native ideas work just as well on the web. This is a clone of the Medley Native sample with divs in place of Views.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Native web example:

    npm install
    npm run build

Then open app.html to see Native web Navigation in action. Like a Native app, the previous scenes stay around and are animated into view when navigating back.
