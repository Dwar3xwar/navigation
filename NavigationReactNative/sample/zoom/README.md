# Native Zoom Navigation
With Navigation you can visually connect items from different scenes by animating an overlay as you navigate from one to the other.

## Run
Follow React Native's Getting Started guide to set up your development environment. Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies:

    npm install

Then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the example on your chosen device. Almost all the code is shared between iOS and Android. Click a colour to zoom it into view and press the ‘X’ to zoom it back out again.
