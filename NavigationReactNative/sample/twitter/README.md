# Native Navigation
Navigation's data-first approach and crumb trail tracking means the router works just as well on Native as it does on the Web. 

## Run
Follow React Native's Getting Started guide to set up your development environment. Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies:

    npm install

Then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the example on your chosen device. Almost all the code is shared between iOS and Android. Play around with `Twitter.js` to see how you can control the animations when changing scenes.
