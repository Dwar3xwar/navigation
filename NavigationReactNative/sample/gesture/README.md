# Native Gesture Navigation
Navigation puts you in control of the animation. Add a PanResponder and move the scene around in response to gestures.

## Run
Follow React Native's Getting Started guide to set up your development environment. Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies:

    npm install

Then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the example on your chosen device. All the code is shared between iOS and Android. Swipe scenes to the right to navigate back.
