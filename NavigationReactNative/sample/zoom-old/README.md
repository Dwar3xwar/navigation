# Native Zoom Navigation
Navigation lets you share elements between scenes. The SharedElementMotion component gives you control over how they animate.

## Run
Follow React Native's Getting Started guide to set up your development environment. Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.

Then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the example on your chosen device. Almost all the code is shared between iOS and Android. The color and text animate from one scene to the next.
